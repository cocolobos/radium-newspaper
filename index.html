                <b>T</b>he canonizing of popular music began in earnest in 1983, when a legendary gatekeeper, the Atlantic Records executive <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1978/05/29/eclectic-reminiscent-amused-fickle-perverse-i">Ahmet Ertegun</a> , convened a cabal of music-industry professionals to create the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The hall was erected with the intent to venerate and deify, and the selections into it reflected the hubris of its creators. “Virtually no mistakes were made,” the Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/10/jann-wenner-to-leave-rock-hall-confident-no-mistakes-were-made-under-his-watch.html">said</a> , referring to the choices, when he stepped down as chairman, last year.

            <p>
                In 2003, Wenner and Rolling Stone engaged in a complementary act of canon-building with a list of the “ <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">500 Greatest Albums of All Time </a>,” a massive undertaking. The list’s flaws were apparent from the beginning. “Predictably,” Edna Gundersen <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-11-16-rolling-stone-list_x.htm">wrote</a> , in USA Today that year, “the list is weighted toward testosterone-fueled vintage rock.” Here was an institution, Rolling Stone, made up primarily of white men, saying that most of the best music ever was made by white men, and leaning on their authority as a counterculture icon to do so. A new Rolling Stone list was revealed last week, with a hundred and fifty-four new entries and some major moves in the rankings. It reflects an admirable attempt by Rolling Stone to evolve with the times and exhibit a more comprehensive consideration of music history. The resulting list was clearly animated by a critical push toward <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html">poptimism</a> and an attempt to diversify the critical class.

                In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/29/why-the-old-pop-music-canon-is-finished-greatest-albums-digital-age">column</a> in the Guardian, from 2018, titled “Bland on Blonde: Why the Old Rock Music Canon Is Finished,” the critic Michael Hann accurately summarized the problems with the current canon: the inherent superiority of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rock-and-roll">rock</a> assumed in the long-standing hierarchy of popular music; the domination of the conversation by white men; and the construction of the canon with albums, a format that many of us still value but which is, quite frankly, obsolete. Hann predicted the rapid fading of the rockist canon and the rise of a new one defined by a more inclusive critical tribunal.

                By then, the shift was already taking place. In 2017, NPR started a reclamation project called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538387823/turning-the-tables-150-greatest-albums-made-by-women">Turning the Tables</a> , a series that put women and their art at the center of a new canon and, by extension, the history of popular music and culture. “We came to a conclusion that, in 2017, will likely strike no one as a surprise: that the general history of popular music is told through the great works of men, and that without a serious revision of the canon, women will always remain on the margins,” the critic Ann Powers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538601651/a-new-canon-in-pop-music-women-belong-at-the-center-of-the-story">wrote</a> . She later added a statement of purpose: “The point is to offer a view of popular music history with women’s work at the center.” Powers theorized that a foundational canon by women about women—one that wasn’t forced to play by established, patriarchal rules—would focus on the collective and not on a pecking order. She cited the poet and feminist Robin Morgan, who, in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sisterhood-Powerful-Robin-Morgan/dp/0394705394?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50">Sisterhood Is Powerful</a>,” from 1970, defined the women’s movement as non-hierarchical, and, therefore, almost antithetical to the ranked list-making process.

                This critical uprising continued well into this year, with similar projects. As a supplement to massive <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/">best-of</a> tent-pole list packages, fashioned in the Rolling Stone 500’s image, Pitchfork continues its exhaustive examinations of scenes and artists, including career recaps for <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/stevie-nicks-in-33-songs/">Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/joni-mitchell-her-art-and-life-in-33-songs/">Joni Mitchell</a>, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/10073-nina-simone-her-art-and-life-in-33-songs/">Nina Simone</a>, and introductions to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/guide-to-urbano-music/">urbano</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/10022-the-50-best-dancehall-songs-of-all-time/">dancehall</a>, outlaw country, and girl groups. The Zora Music Canon took the Turning the Tables series to its logical conclusion and focussed on Black women. Black Music Reframed, by uDiscover, focussed on letting Black writers contextualize Black music—which is to say, American music. NPR’s celebration of Southern rap sought to bring balance to a largely bicoastal hip-hop discourse. Notably, most of these projects went unranked. It isn’t just that critics are now rethinking what warrants inclusion; they are also rethinking the list itself and who it serves.
