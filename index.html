                <b>T</b>he canonizing of popular music began in earnest in 1983, when a legendary gatekeeper, the Atlantic Records executive <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1978/05/29/eclectic-reminiscent-amused-fickle-perverse-i">Ahmet Ertegun</a> , convened a cabal of music-industry professionals to create the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The hall was erected with the intent to venerate and deify, and the selections into it reflected the hubris of its creators. “Virtually no mistakes were made,” the Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/arts/2019/10/jann-wenner-to-leave-rock-hall-confident-no-mistakes-were-made-under-his-watch.html">said</a> , referring to the choices, when he stepped down as chairman, last year.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003, Wenner and Rolling Stone engaged in a complementary act of canon-building with a list of the “ <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">500 Greatest Albums of All Time </a>,” a massive undertaking. The list’s flaws were apparent from the beginning. “Predictably,” Edna Gundersen <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-11-16-rolling-stone-list_x.htm">wrote</a> , in USA Today that year, “the list is weighted toward testosterone-fueled vintage rock.” Here was an institution, Rolling Stone, made up primarily of white men, saying that most of the best music ever was made by white men, and leaning on their authority as a counterculture icon to do so. A new Rolling Stone list was revealed last week, with a hundred and fifty-four new entries and some major moves in the rankings. It reflects an admirable attempt by Rolling Stone to evolve with the times and exhibit a more comprehensive consideration of music history. The resulting list was clearly animated by a critical push toward <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html">poptimism</a> and an attempt to diversify the critical class.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/29/why-the-old-pop-music-canon-is-finished-greatest-albums-digital-age">column</a> in the Guardian, from 2018, titled “Bland on Blonde: Why the Old Rock Music Canon Is Finished,” the critic Michael Hann accurately summarized the problems with the current canon: the inherent superiority of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rock-and-roll">rock</a> assumed in the long-standing hierarchy of popular music; the domination of the conversation by white men; and the construction of the canon with albums, a format that many of us still value but which is, quite frankly, obsolete. Hann predicted the rapid fading of the rockist canon and the rise of a new one defined by a more inclusive critical tribunal.

                By then, the shift was already taking place. In 2017, NPR started a reclamation project called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538387823/turning-the-tables-150-greatest-albums-made-by-women">Turning the Tables</a> , a series that put women and their art at the center of a new canon and, by extension, the history of popular music and culture. “We came to a conclusion that, in 2017, will likely strike no one as a surprise: that the general history of popular music is told through the great works of men, and that without a serious revision of the canon, women will always remain on the margins,” the critic Ann Powers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538601651/a-new-canon-in-pop-music-women-belong-at-the-center-of-the-story">wrote</a> . She later added a statement of purpose: “The point is to offer a view of popular music history with women’s work at the center.” Powers theorized that a foundational canon by women about women—one that wasn’t forced to play by established, patriarchal rules—would focus on the collective and not on a pecking order. She cited the poet and feminist Robin Morgan, who, in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sisterhood-Powerful-Robin-Morgan/dp/0394705394?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50">Sisterhood Is Powerful</a>,” from 1970, defined the women’s movement as non-hierarchical, and, therefore, almost antithetical to the ranked list-making process.

                This critical uprising continued well into this year, with similar projects. As a supplement to massive <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/">best-of</a> tent-pole list packages, fashioned in the Rolling Stone 500’s image, Pitchfork continues its exhaustive examinations of scenes and artists, including career recaps for <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/stevie-nicks-in-33-songs/">Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/joni-mitchell-her-art-and-life-in-33-songs/">Joni Mitchell</a>, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/10073-nina-simone-her-art-and-life-in-33-songs/">Nina Simone</a>, and introductions to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/guide-to-urbano-music/">urbano</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/10022-the-50-best-dancehall-songs-of-all-time/">dancehall</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-story-of-outlaw-country-in-33-songs/">outlaw country</a>, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-story-of-girl-groups-in-45-songs/">girl groups</a>.The <a href="https://zora.medium.com/the-zora-music-canon-5a29296c6112">Zora Music Canon</a> took the Turning the Tables series to its logical conclusion and focussed on Black women. <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/black-music-reframed-introduction/">Black Music Reframed</a>, by uDiscover, focussed on letting Black writers contextualize Black music—which is to say, American music. NPR’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/07/899849680/the-south-got-something-to-say-is-a-celebratory-canon-of-southern-rap">celebration of Southern rap</a>  sought to bring balance to a largely bicoastal hip-hop discourse. Notably, most of these projects went unranked. It isn’t just that critics are now rethinking what warrants inclusion; they are also rethinking the list itself and who it serves.

                Remaking the Rolling Stone 500 in this image required not just adaptation but a bit of soul-searching for the magazine. The publication historically <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2018/08/21/book-review-only-girl-my-life-and-times-masthead-rolling-stone-robin-green-jann-wenner/1042609002/">mirrored</a> the sexism of the music scene that it covered, and was restricted by the narrow perspective shared among its mostly white staff. In an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/the-women-who-transformed-rolling-stone-in-the-mid-70s">oral history</a> of the women behind the transformational Rolling Stone run in the mid-seventies, the copy chief Barbara Downey Landau recalled a sign hanging over the desk of Wenner’s secretary that read “Boys’ Club,” in huge letters. The former associate editor Christine Doudna described it as “a guy’s magazine” with a very male sensibility. The effects of that framework lingered through the release of the 2003 list and <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/media/rolling-stone-travis-scott-first-cover-by-black-photographer-1202949367/">beyond</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a persistent perception of Rolling Stone as a stodgy institution standing on hard-line rockist ideals that seems tough for some to shake—it’s the magazine that gives Bruce Springsteen <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2012/03/bruce-springsteens-rolling-stone-reviews-why-does-the-magazine-love-him-so-much.html">five stars for everything</a>, that championed U2’s invasive iPhone experiment as <a href="https://uproxx.com/music/rolling-stone-u2-album-of-the-year-jann-wenner-bono-2014/">the best album of 2014</a>, and that will find any excuse to write about the Beatles. (Ten years after writing about <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-the-beatles-broke-up-113403/">why the band broke up</a>, they <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/beatles-inside-breakup-50-years-later-1042196/">did it again</a>.) All of those things are true, but the characterization isn’t entirely fair. The Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield has enthusiastically received next-generation stars like the One Direction front man turned rock proxy <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-harry-styles-is-a-true-rock-star-on-superb-solo-debut-119736/">Harry Styles</a> or the K-pop supergroup <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bts-map-of-the-soul-7-2-957346/">BTS</a>. Lil Baby and Bad Bunny were recent cover stars. The magazine’s best album of 2019 was Ariana Grande’s “thank u, next.” Despite these choices, many readers still see Rolling Stone as the standard-bearer for the antiquated “rock” mainstream.

            <p>
                The way forward for Rolling Stone was to consult a wider array of music enthusiasts, in the hope of covering blind spots. The biggest change with the 2020 list is the diversified <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/voters-500-greatest-albums-list-1062225/">voting pool</a>—more than three hundred artists, journalists, and industry figures from across genres participated. Two hundred and seventy-three people voted for the original list, but, finally, the demographics of the voters has been expanded. The Alabama Shakes front person Brittany Howard voted. The Cash Money Records executive Ronald (Slim) Williams voted. I voted. From Beyoncé, Alice Bag, and Billie Eilish to Lin-Manuel Miranda, Herbie Hancock, and Gene Simmons, the 2020 list puts greater emphasis on variety. Poptimism is clearly making headway: more rap, more Robyn, more Shakira, more Lady Gaga. Britney Spears’s “Blackout” outranks albums by Neil Young, the Grateful Dead, and Ornette Coleman. But aspirations to fundamentally change the list, and list-making, are mostly thwarted by methodology.
